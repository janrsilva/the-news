This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

or if you don't have docker installed, you shall not pass. Just kidding, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

So, you need to follow the instructions in the app to setup an News API key.
